# MacOS

## .DS_Store

This file

### Why

I usually work between different systems(Windows, macOS, Linux), so the '.DS_Store' file generated by MacOS doesn't help me, and it's disturbing when I copy or backup the entire folder to my external storage, then see those files in other systems.

Although it won't have a significant performance impact, of course, I could also choose not to show the hidden files, but I still decide to remove those files and turn that off.

### Delete all .DS_Store files in the system

```sh
sudo find / -name ".DS_Store" -depth -exec rm {} \;
```

### Turn the feature off

```sh
defaults write com.apple.finder AppleShowAllFiles -bool false
```
